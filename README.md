# jngramtool

This package is aimed at linguistic uses of ngrams, aimed at a number of tasks concerning Irish data. Among the tasks it performs are n-gram reduction (removing lower order n-grams that are completely contained by higher order n-grams); extraction of lexical bundles (in this case, n-grams that do not span punctuation boundaries) from a corpus, while retaining information about author, field, and year, for further restriction. The package contains a partial clone of kfNgram.
